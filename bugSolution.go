The issue isn't a bug; it's a characteristic of Go's memory management. The compiler and runtime optimize memory allocation, so addresses may not be consistent across runs or even within the same run.  There's no fix; it's important to understand that the addresses themselves are not typically relevant to the logic of your application.  Focus on the values stored at those addresses instead.
